\noindent The simplicity and power of Smalltalk combined with a live environment provided by Pharo create a perfect environment for data analysis. The advanced debugging and inspecting tools together with the library for agile visualizations allow us to communicate and play with every object in our system. This includes all the logical components of both data and the algorithm. Provided the proper tools and open source libraries for machine learning, statistics, and optimization, Pharo can become both powerful tool for professional data analysts, and a simple environment for everyone who wants to play with a data set. Many important tools and algorithms are already implemented in PolyMath. But the essential part of data analysis toolkit is missing - the specialized data structures for tabular data sets with a simple and powerful API for summarizing, cleaning, and manipulating the data. In this paper I introduce \texttt{DataFrame} and \texttt{DataSeries} - the new collections specifically designed for working with structured data. I demonstrate how these tools can be used for descriptive statistics and the exploratory data analysis - the critical first step of data analysis which allows us to get the summary of a data set, detect mistakes, determine the relations, and select the appropriate model for further confirmatory analysis.

All pictures in this paper are the built-in DataFrame visualizations that are created with Roassal2 and can be reproduced by following the steps in section \

\paragraph{Paper structure} In the first section I provide a brief introduction into the explanatory data analysis. What is it good for? How to do it right? I will also provide you with all the basic knowledge about statistics and data analysis, such as statistical variable, types of variables etc. In the second section I briefly describe the DataFrame - new data structure for data analysis. In the following section I will give a step-by-step example of how to perform EDA on the well-known Iris data set.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
\label{sec:eda}

Everything that doesn't include fitting model to a data is an exploratory data analysis.

Here are the main reasons we use EDA:
\begin{itemize}
  \item detection of mistakes
  \item checking of assumptions
  \item preliminary selection of appropriate models
  \item determining relationships among the explanatory variables
  \item assessing the direction and rough size of relationships between explanatory and outcome variables
\end{itemize}

%\section{Proposed Solution}%
\section{Exploring the Iris Data Set}
\label{sec:contribution}

Free form, variable number of sections, technical details.

But in general do not mix solution and discussions/possible variation
let that for discussion

We can start by loading iris data set from a CSV file.
\begin{code}{}
data := DataFrame fromCsv: '/path/to/iris.csv'.
\end{code}

DataFrame comes with a built-in collection of data sets that are widely used as examples for data analysis and machine learning problems. Iris is among them, so an alternative way of loading it would be simply

\begin{code}{}
data := DataFrame loadIris.
\end{code}

Now let's take a look at the first and the last 5 entries in our table. These slices are called \textit{head} and \textit{tail} of a data frame.

\begin{code}{}
data head.
data tail.
\end{code}

\subsection{Univariate non-graphical EDA}
To access a single variable we ask a data frame for a specific column, using its name or integer index

\begin{code}{}
var := data column: #sepal_width. "Accessing column by its name"
var := data columnAt: 1. "Getting column by index"
\end{code}

What we can do with a column depends on a type of statistical variable it represents. If the variable is categorical, we can ..., if its quantitative, we can look at the ... statistics.

\begin{code}{}
var min.
var max.
var range.
var average. "a.k.a. mean"
var median.
var mode.
var stdev.
\end{code}

\subsection{Univariate graphical EDA}
\subsubsection{Categorical}

Histogram is the only graphical technique that can be used for a categorical variable.

\begin{code}{}
var := data column: #species.
var barplot.
\end{code}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{species_bar}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multivariate graphical EDA}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{boxplot}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Let's look at the scatterplot of two statistical variables representing the width and length of a sepal. To do that we ask our DataFrame to give us specific columns, in our case, \texttt{sepal\_width} and \texttt{sepal\_length}, then we ask these columns (the result will be another DataFrame) to visualize themselves.

\begin{code}{}
vars := data columns: #(sepal_width sepal_length).
vars scatterplot.
\end{code}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{sepal_wl_scatter}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Discussion of actual solution \emph{vs.} initial constraints from
\ref{sec:problem}. Explain the space of the solution, why we made it this way.

Evaluation of the solution. How does the solution meet the criteria? Where
does it succeed or fails...


\section{Related Works}
\label{sec:related}

Other solutions in the domain, and a real comparison of our contribution with
solutions from other people.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we \textsf{looked}\xspace at problem P with this context and these
constraints. We proposed solution S. It has such good points and such not so
good ones. Now we could do this or that.
